Regression Analysis: Building linear models to predict sales based on factors like reviews and pricing.

Correlation Analysis: Assessing the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

Tools Used

R Programming Language: Main tool for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Libraries:

tidyverse for data manipulation and plotting.

ggplot2 for creating advanced visualizations.

emmeans for post hoc tests in linear models.

Hmisc and car for statistical operations and diagnostic tests.

Results

Bike Hires: Despite the pandemic, there was an increasing trend in bike hires over the years, with significant drops during the initial lockdown periods.
